# public-windows-scripts
List of Windows scripts in various languages and with various tasks. Sometimes they are a bit of a hack :-)

Note:
- I replaced all keys and idetifiers with xxxxxs or so. You need to set these accordingly
- There are a lot of tricks and hacks in there to work with MS Graph API. I had to research painfully and I share so you do not have to.
